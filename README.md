day 3 - 15.12.2025 - medium Branch
  -added the BackendMediumMaths class and included the following items
    -Kenetic Energy
    -Weight
    -Hydrostatic Pressure
    -Elastic Potential Energy
    -Converting total
  -I also made everything a double as with this you can do sums like 0.5 x 5 x (2 x 2) which is what I used to
    test the Kenetic Energy. I found that with this being an Integer, i have struggled to do the 0.5 section of
    some of the medium sums located in "BackendMediumMaths".
  -I created the files for the different sums within this section of the app.
  -I completed the different areas in this order
    1 - Kenetic Energy
    2 - Elastic Potential Energy
    3 - Weight
    4 - Hydrostatic Pressure
