Day 1 - 05.12.2025 - Simple Branch 
  -Made the UI and get a re-usable GUI base set up 
  -Set up the Simple Sum menu, in which i discovered that order is very important for this library

Day 2 - 06.12.2025 - Simple Branch 
  -made the Simple sum menu more organised and figured out how to make pictures buttons  
  -made all of the classes for the simple operators, this was so i could impliment each one without confusing myself 
  -added all of base information for the windows to work 
  -added functionality for all of the Simple Sums and got them all working 
  -need to work on error handling

Day 3 - 15.12.2025 - medium Branch
  -added all the functionality for the medium branch and made everything for it
  
Day 4 - 17.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -Created the Azimuth method in BackendHardMaths 
  -created the hard menu and Azimuth Screens in java

Day 5 - 18.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -Did error handling with Azimuth in order to check for empty string, just need to work on how to message gets put out that it's wrong.

Day 6 - 19.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -added the facotrial method and decided to use recursion to demonstrate i know and also to reduce the time taken. -Got factorial to work however it's messier then others due to the way i've done the return

Day 7 - 23.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -added the sorting logic, i split this away from the BackendHardMaths as it would have not made sense and also i know where to look for errors if this were to break

Day 8 - 26.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -worked and created the next page checker, also discovered a different type of dialogue box. 
  -Tested to see if the pagination worked, it did but is rather slow so i might look into how i can fix the entry
  -Did the sorting section.

Day 9 - 27.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -got the pagination working how i wanted it.(personally happy with this as it's something i've struggled with in  
    the past); 
  -added a prime checker (checkes if a number is prime)

Day 10 - 28.12.2025 - hard Branch 
  -Added error handling to azimuth. this involved me taking out the if statement 
  -added the proper results page for azimuth (dont know why i did not add it at the time) 
  -changed the return type and changed the relevent types in the right places to accomodate for large numbers in the factorial section 
  -added error handling to factorial 
  -added error handling to the sorting logic (if the arraylist is empty, it will tell the user that) 
  -noticed that i had the view button on the sorting screen read in the number which was not needed so set it to 
    0.0 as for that change it didnt require it however i need it to change into different section of my sorting code 
  -added error handling for invalid entry types on sorting screen 
  -added error handling for invalid entry types on PrimeChecker
